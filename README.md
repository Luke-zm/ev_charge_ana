# Indepth analysis of EV user's charging behaviour in Leeds, UK  

In this project, we aim to give an indepth analysis of how are EV users charging their EV.    
This can then give us some insights on what are the impacts to the power grid, and how to use technologies like smart charging to mitigate these issues. 

The data used in this project is obtained from [Leeds City Council](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/5bb5c097-0e2f-42a3-8aee-1c0189a39082/electric-vehicle-chargepoints-operated-by-leeds-city-council).
